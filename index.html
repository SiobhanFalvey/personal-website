        <p>I am an articulate, energetic and focussed person. I am good at learning new skills and problem solving. I am very keen to consolidate and expand my knowledge as a junior developer. I am hard-working, well organised, and have experience working in an agile environment.</p></section>
        <section class="section-two"><h2>My Journey</h2>
        <p>I originally pursued a buying and merchandising career but after work experience and retails jobs I realised that it wasn’t for me. 
                I recognised that the tech industry was a fantastic opportunity to learn and develop new skill and due to its rapidly expanding nature I could constantly adapt and challenge myself but never thought I would have the chance to join it. 
                The _nology course gave me an opportunity to invest in myself and my career and strangely has a linked to my previous path in buying, through the understanding of what makes a good product and how the presentation of that product influences people to buy. </p></section>
        <section class="section-three"><h2>_Nology</h2>
        <p>I completed a twelve-week intensive tech conversion bootcamp. I learnt the tech stack referenced above to a level where I can set up a project, implement it, recognise and fix problems. However, I appreciate I still have a lot to learn. As well as further developing a range of soft skills including pair programming, organisation, listening, presenting and client rapport. In the twelve weeks, I have worked as a team to complete one client project that was a personal performance monitor, tracking users' personal objectives across health, wealth and relationships. My contribution to the project was the functionality behind the questionnaire page and the design and functionality of the progress bar. I produced and delivered a mock TED talk on Artificial Intelligence in trend forecasting in the fashion industry and started my own personal interest project, which is a comprehensive organisational React application.</p></section>
